# UnityMediaPipe


This is a project that tests Google MediaPipePose inside of Unity using Python bindings. Reading the WebCam and running the model occur on different threads. Basically, it's configurable full body tracking using a WebCam. What's more is that you can stay inside of a Python environment for all the mediapipe stuff (use all your usual libraries).
